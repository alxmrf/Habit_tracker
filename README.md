## About The Project

Alexandre 'Kinsa' had this awesome idea to make a project about a Habit Tracker for desktop, and he invited Banr to be part of it. So, they started building it ;)

What are gonna be the main points of our Habit Tracker:
* It's open source
* It works well on desktop (Mobile in the future maybe?)
* Help people get on a better path on their life :smile:

Of course, there's gonna be bugs, if you happen to find any, let us know.

Use the `linkToGetStarted` to get started.
